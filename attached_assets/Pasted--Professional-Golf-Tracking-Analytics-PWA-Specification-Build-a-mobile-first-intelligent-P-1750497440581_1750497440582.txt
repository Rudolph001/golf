also include this: Update Your App to Include GPS & Weather In client/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx, use the code from the previous message that calls useLocationWeather() and displays coordinates + weather. Create client/src/lib/useLocationWeather.ts and add the GPS + weather hook. Make sure: Your app builds without TypeScript errors You have replaced "YOUR_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY" with your real API key from https://openweathermap.org

🌦️ GPS + Weather Integration
✅ Steps to Add Location-Based Weather to Dashboard:
1.	Create a new hook:
📄 client/src/lib/useLocationWeather.ts
Add a custom React hook that:
•	Uses the browser's Geolocation API
•	Fetches weather data from OpenWeatherMap
•	Returns coordinates and current weather details
2.	Update the Dashboard page:
📄 client/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx
Use the hook like this:
tsx
CopyEdit
import useLocationWeather from "@/lib/useLocationWeather";

const Dashboard = () => {
  const { coordinates, weather, error } = useLocationWeather();

  return (
    <div>
      <h1 className="text-xl font-bold">Dashboard</h1>
      {error && <p>Error: {error}</p>}
      {coordinates && (
        <p>Location: {coordinates.latitude}, {coordinates.longitude}</p>
      )}
      {weather && (
        <div>
          <p>Temperature: {weather.temp}°C</p>
          <p>Conditions: {weather.description}</p>
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};
3.	Replace the placeholder API key:
Ensure you replace "YOUR_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY" in useLocationWeather.ts with a real API key from:
🔗 https://openweathermap.org
✅ Checklist:
•	 App builds without TypeScript errors
•	 useLocationWeather.ts properly handles async + error states
•	 Valid API key is used
•	 Coordinates and weather display successfully on the dashboard
